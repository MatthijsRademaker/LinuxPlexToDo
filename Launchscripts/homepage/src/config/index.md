  - title: Plex
    icon: { src: /assets/plex.svg }
    details: I've divided my plex server into 4 separate libraries. Movies, Anime Movies, Series, and Anime Series. Most of the content is in 1080p and some movies will be in 4k. If an item is not present on my server you can use overseerr to request it. Happy watching :)
  - title: Overseerr
    icon: { src: /assets/overseerr.svg }
    details: Overseerr is used to request films and shows. For movies you can request it in 1080p format, if you prefer the movie in 4k send me a message on discord and i'll review it. For shows it is also possible to request separate seasons also in 1080p. Animes are handled in separate instances, in the same way.
  - title: Discord
    icon: { src: /assets/discord.svg }
    details: 'Discord is used for general communication, downtime reporting, and for request management from Overseerr.
